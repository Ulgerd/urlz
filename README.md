# Urlz

Functional toolkit for URLs. Drop-in [`url`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html) and
[`querystring`](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html) replacement.
Originally built for a static site generator where URL transformations are common, but use-cases
are really unlimited.

### Features

* High-level URL manipulations
* Curried composable API
* Crossplatform: works in NodeJS and all modern browsers
* Extensive test suite

Dependencies:
* [`pathz`](https://github.com/ivan-kleshnin/pathz)

Peer dependencies:
* [`url`](https://nodejs.org/api/url)
* [`querystring`](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring)
* [`@paqmind/ramda`](http://ramdajs.com/) (temp. until basic Ramda)

## Usage

```
$ npm install urlz
```

```js
let U = require("urlz")

// The following snippets also use shortcuts for:
let R = require("ramda")
let UU = require("url")
```

### Browser

Webpack's `path-browserify` dependency (polyfill of `path`) is very old and severily [bugged](https://github.com/substack/path-browserify/issues).
Hey, it doesn't even provide a `parse` function! So you'll have to substitute it with another package.

```
$ npm install path-webpack
```

Add the following to your `webpack.config.js`:

```js
resolve: {
  alias: {
    path: "path-webpack"
  }
}
```

This can fix other libraries naively depending on `path` as well. Other bundlers, like Browserify
or Rollup, should support such replacement as well.

## Glossary

1. `http://foo.com/bar/baz` – absolute URL
2. `foo.com/bar/baz` – invalid URL, may occur in human text (*)
3. `/bar/baz` – root-relative URL (not absolute!)
4. `bar/baz` – relative URL

* – should be specially handled with libs like [`normalize-url`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize-url).
We don't provide normalization heuristics here (yet).

## Motivation

#### 1. Original `format` / `parse` provide limited, low-level, mutable API

There is also newer WHATWG `URL` API but it [doesn't support](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/12682) relative
URLs. Which basically makes it unusable for many scenarios. So while NodeJS renders `url` as [deprecated](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html)
it's still much better than WHATWG version (unsurprisingly).

#### 2. `urlz` is trailing slash aware

Trailing slash is significant in some cases. It may affect backend routing AND it affects relative URLs:
* [Link-1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5457885/relative-urls-and-trailing-slashes)
* [Link-2](https://cdivilly.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/why-trailing-slashes-on-uris-are-important/)

`urlz` doesn't assume anything and keeps trailing slash untouched for all operations where it's possible.

#### 3. `urlz` respects "relativeness" and "absoluteness" of urls

```js
console.log(U.addLeftDir("bar", "/foo.txt"))  // "/bar/foo.txt" (+)
console.log(UU.join("bar", "/foo.txt"))       // "bar/foo.txt"  (-) naive

console.log(U.addRightDir("bar", "/foo.txt")) // "/bar/foo.txt" (+)
console.log(UU.join("/foo.txt", "bar"))       // "/foo.txt/bar" (-) naive
```

#### 4. `urlz` is composition friendly

```js
let R = require("ramda")

let src = "content/team/about.md"
let dst = R.pipe(
  U.withLeftDir("public"),
  U.addRightDir(P.name(src)),
  U.withBase("index.html")
)(src)

console.log(dst) // "public/team/about/index.html"
                 // corresponding to "/team/about/" URL
```

#### 5. `urlz` is like CRUD for path fragments

```js
// GET
console.log(U.leftDir("/foo/bar/baz.txt"))  // "foo"
console.log(U.rightDir("/foo/bar/baz.txt")) // "bar"

// UPDATE
console.log(U.withLeftDir ("qux", "/foo/bar/baz.txt")) // "/qux/bar/baz.txt"
console.log(U.withRightDir("qux", "/foo/bar/baz.txt")) // "/foo/qux/baz.txt"

// DELETE
console.log(U.dropLeftDir ("/foo/bar/baz.txt")) // "/bar/baz.txt"
console.log(U.dropRightDir("/foo/bar/baz.txt")) // "/foo/baz.txt"

// ...
```
